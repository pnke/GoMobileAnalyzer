# EAS Build Ignore (Git Root)
# If EAS CLI is determining context from git root, we need to ignore from here.

# Ignore the huge ServerGo folder entirely (unless you need it for build script context?)
# Assuming purely frontend build:
ServerGo/

# App native folders (regenerated)
App/android/
App/ios/

# App dependencies
App/node_modules/

# App build artifacts
App/dist/
App/web-build/
App/coverage/

# App Expo config
App/.expo/

# Standard ignores
.DS_Store
*.jks
*.keystore
*.p12
credentials.json
